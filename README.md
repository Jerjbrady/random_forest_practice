# random_forest_practice
python code for a random forest projects

Introduction
As you're learning, random forests are popular statistical learning algorithms. Some of their primary benefits include reducing variance, bias, and the chance of overfitting.

This activity is a continuation of the project you began modeling with decision trees for an airline. Here, you will train, tune, and evaluate a random forest model using data from spreadsheet of survey responses from 129,880 customers. It includes data points such as class, flight distance, and inflight entertainment. Your random forest model will be used to predict whether a customer will be satisfied with their flight experience.
